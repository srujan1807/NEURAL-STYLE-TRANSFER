Descrpition:
This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST), a deep learning technique that blends the content of one image with the style of another to create stunning, artistic visuals. It uses a pre-trained VGG-19 model to extract high-level image features and optimize a new image that combines the desired content and style.

üöÄ Features
Transfer artistic styles from famous paintings to your own images

Built using PyTorch / TensorFlow (specify which one you used)

Supports custom content and style images

Adjustable weights for content and style loss

üìÅ How It Works
Load the content image and style image.

Extract features using a pre-trained CNN (VGG-19).

Optimize a target image to minimize a loss function combining:

Content loss (difference in content features)

Style loss (difference in Gram matrices of style features)

Output the stylized image.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python

PyTorch / TensorFlow (mention the framework)

NumPy

PIL / Matplotlib
